	<p> I was born in 1990 in the great state of Texas. When I was a little kid I always wanted to create and build something that blows people mines. </p>

	<p> When I was about to graduate high school I didn't know what I want to do in my life. When I first got out of high school I attend UTI in Houston, Tx for collision repair and finish. I graduate in 2009 then went to Capitol City Trade and Technical School for automotive. I finish in 2010, so my whole idea was to create and build awsome cars. I went in to the field but the money wasn't there and I found out that I enjoy working on cars as a hobby. Then I went to ITT in Austin, Tx and graduated in 2015 with a AS in Electrial Engineering. I did found a job as maintenance Tech but like I said earlier I want to create and build. All I was doing in the field was troubleshooting and repairing. Know I find myself programming and enjoying the creation I make. I have found my dream career. </p>
